# G. William Buryat Taka • Steppe36

Just a friendly neighborhood Data LARPer.

I build a polycentric world where music, code, and theology fold together. The work lives inside the Steppe vision and the BahnMus CyberSoul.

## Core Vision

- **Samael Intelligence (SI):** ethical compass for choices in the gray.
- **Clandestine Intelligence (CI):** tradecraft for integrity and transparency.
- **Divine Intelligence (DI):** reciprocity between spirit and code.

These sit inside the **Kusudama Effect**. Ideas are clustered without a single center. Many petals, one thread.

## What I am doing now

- Small ML and signal projects that link to composition and story.
- Lightweight tools that run on modest hardware.
- Clean notebooks and examples that others can replay.
